## Senior Software Engineer | Backend & Systems Architect

I am a senior-level software engineer and technology entrepreneur with extensive experience across multiple programming languages, ecosystems, and architectural styles. My primary focus is backend engineering, system design, and building production-grade software that remains reliable under real-world constraints.

I work with a broad spectrum of programming languages and frameworks, selecting tools based on suitability, performance, and long-term maintainability. I do not work with the C programming language; all other technologies are adopted pragmatically according to project requirements.

## Programming Languages

I have hands-on experience with multiple programming paradigms, including compiled, interpreted, functional, and scripting languages.

**Languages in active use:**
- Go  
- Java  
- Python  
- Elixir  
- PHP  
- TypeScript  
- Ruby  

> **Note:** I do not use the C programming language.

## Engineering Approach

- Systems are designed for clarity before complexity  
- Code is written to be read, debugged, and maintained  
- Architectural decisions are driven by production needs  
- Automation is preferred over manual processes  
- Reliability and scalability are non-negotiable  

---

## Current Focus

- Backend platforms for operational automation  
- AI-enhanced software systems  
- Scalable service architectures  
- Long-term maintainability of production codebases  

---

## Professional Objective

My objective is to design and deliver software systems that solve real operational problems and remain stable as they scale. I am particularly interested in roles and projects involving backend architecture, system automation, and applied artificial intelligence.

---

## Collaboration

Open to:
- Senior-level backend roles  
- System architecture and consulting  
- AI-integrated software projects  

GitHub is my primary platform for technical collaboration and code distribution.
