## ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

```
[01] Clarity precedes complexity
     Simple solutions preferred until complexity is justified

[02] Code is written for humans
     Readability, debuggability, and maintainability are non-negotiable

[03] Architecture driven by production needs
     Design decisions based on real-world operational requirements

[04] Automation over manual processes
     Human time is valuable; repetitive tasks must be automated

[05] Reliability and scalability are baseline requirements
     Systems must handle growth and remain operational under load

[06] Performance is a feature
     Optimization is integral to design, not an afterthought
